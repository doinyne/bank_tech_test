# bank_tech_test

Hello, I decided to use Ruby for this tech test. 

My bank is very generous and offers a Â£200 overdraft.

## to set up a new bank account 

```
irb

require './lib/bank.rb'

account = Bank.new
```
``` 
account.deposit(#integer) = to deposit cash
account.withdraw(#integer) = to withdraw cash
account.statement = printed statement with date stamp
account.balance = to view current balance of account 
```

## Specification

clone repo

run bundle install

### Requirements

* You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or the JavaScript console.  (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
* Deposits, withdrawal.
* Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
* Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

### Acceptance criteria

**Given** a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2023  
**And** a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2023  
**And** a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2023  
**When** she prints her bank statement  
**Then** she would see

```
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2023 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2023 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2023 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00
```
